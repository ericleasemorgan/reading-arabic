# Reading Arabic

This is a little system used to read some Arabic texts for the ultimate purpose of creating a network diagram illustrating what places were influential to other places from the texts. This system ought to work on an sane version of Linux / Mac OS X, but you will need an additional system called MADAMIRA in order to parse the given text into parts-of-speech values.
